IMPORTANT: not for use on production sites (for now)

This project is focused on resolving the recurring problem of managing external apps when working with django projects by taking a different approach: custom commands.

== Installation and Settings ==

1) Download application from Github
2) Make sure the application is under a django project or is added to the python path
3) Add 'external_downloads' on the INSTALLED_APPS variable of your django project
4) Define the folder of your external applications by setting a new variable on your django settings project
    EXTERNAL_APPS_FOLDER = '/path/to/external_apps'
5) create a file inside the external apps folder and name it external.apps 
    this is the file where to set the diferent sources.
    the current format is <application_name> <repository url> <repository type>
6) execute 
    ./manage.py external_apps_downloader

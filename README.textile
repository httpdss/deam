h1. DEAM (Django External Apps Manager)

**IMPORTANT: not for use on production sites (for now)**

This project is focused on resolving the recurring problem of managing external apps when working with django projects by taking a different approach: custom commands.

h2. Installation

# Download DEAM from Github
# Add DEAM to your python path and to the INSTALLED_APPS on your project

h2. Setting Up

The first step is to choose in which folder you will have your external applications. This folders will have to include a file called ***external.apps*** with the following file format:

Format for the apps file:
<pre>
     <code>
        [app_name]
        url: project url
        type: vcs type
        directory: directory wanted
        ...
        [other app_name]
        ...
    </code>
</pre>

After correctly setting the external.apps files on your different folders, you can now execute this commands from your project root:
# Download or update a single application: python manage.py get_apps [app_name]
# List all external applications: _python manage.py -l_
# Download or update all applications: _python manage.py -a_
